BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

I'm working on building my personal portfolio, and I'm implementing a full CRUD operations web app using Django. The portfolio will 
feature several pages, starting with a home page showcasing beautiful images related to technology and professional design elements.

Additionally, I'll have a projects page where I'll display links, URLs, and details about my various projects. For visitors interested 
in my skills and expertise, there will be a dedicated skills page.

To add a personal touch, I'll include customized videos, recommended books, and the ability to display PDF documents.
 Lastly, I'll have a hobbies page where I'll share my interests and likes.

Throughout the development process, I'll be documenting each step to provide insights into how the project evolves
 and how each feature is implemented.
